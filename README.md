# Mimik
This cheeky little Python script is used to generate valid South African ID numbers and Visa/Mastercard credit card numbers. Although I wrote this years ago, I still use it all the time.
## How To Use It
- For ID Numbers: python mimik.py -i YY MM DD
- For CC Numbers: python mimik.py -i YY MM DD -c visa/mastercard
